# SoccerCompetitionsStudy
I created studies for different soccer competitions finals, with different datasets for each:
**Europe**
- UEFA Champions League
- UEFA Europa League
- UEFA Intertoto Cup
- UEFA Euro

**Americas**
- Copa Libertadores
- Copa Sudamericana

**Global**
- FIFA World Cup

Each dataset has data about the finalists, the final score(s), their countries of origin, the venue(s), the attendance(s), the way the match was won (in normal, extra time, after penalty shootout, etc...)

Based on this data, I plotted graphs for us to visualize all this information in a more illustrative way.
