# SoccerCompetitionsStudy
Initially I created studies for both UEFA CHampions League and UEFA Europa League, with different datasets for each.

Each dataset has data about the finalists, the final score(s), their countries of origin, the venue(s), the attendance(s), the way the match was won (in normal, extra time, after penalty shootout, etc...)

Based on this data, I plotted graphs for us to visualize all this information in a more illustrative way.
